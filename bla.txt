1️⃣ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — Foundation
Roles
USER
ADMIN
(Keep it simple. Overengineering here adds zero value.)
Backend Rules (Strict)
Every admin API checks:
JWT validity
Role === ADMIN
UI hiding ≠ security
Backend validation is mandatory.
Strong opinion:
If admin routes work by just changing frontend URL → project loses credibility.
2️⃣ Admin Authentication Flow
Login
Separate /admin/login
Same auth system, different role
Optional: separate admin panel route
Token Strategy
Same JWT + refresh token setup
Short-lived access token
Refresh token stored securely
Interview framing
“I reused the same secure auth system with role-based authorization instead of duplicating logic.” 
That shows engineering maturity.
3️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Landing Page)
KPIs to show (minimum)
Total revenue
Total orders
Pending orders
Active users
Why this matters
Recruiters instantly understand:
“This person thinks in terms of metrics.”
Even fake data is fine — logic must be real.
4️⃣ Product Management (ADMIN CRUD)
Capabilities
Add product
Edit product
Delete (soft delete)
Upload multiple images
Manage variants (size/color + stock)
Backend Design (Clean)
Product service
Image upload service
Validation layer
Strong opinion:
Put product logic in services, not routes. Routes should be thin.
5️⃣ Inventory Stock Control (This Is a Big Signal)
Rules
Stock tracked per variant
Stock auto-decreases on order
Prevent overselling
Low-stock flag for admin
Why recruiters like this
It shows:
Data consistency
Real business constraints
Edge-case thinking
6️⃣ Order Management Panel
Order States
PENDING
PACKED
SHIPPED
DELIVERED
CANCELLED
Admin Powers
View all orders
Update order status
See payment status
See user + address
Important
Only admin can move order forward.
User can only view.
7️⃣ Coupon Management (Rule Engine Lite)
Coupon Features
Code (unique)
Discount type (flat / percentage)
Expiry date
Usage limit per user
Minimum cart value
Backend Enforcement
Validate coupon server-side
Reject expired/overused coupons
Interview gold
“I built a rule-based coupon validation system.”
8️⃣ User Management (Compliance Thinking)
Admin Actions
View users
Block / unblock user
View order history
Blocking Logic
Blocked users:
Cannot login
Cannot place orders
Soft delete only. Always.
9️⃣ Sales Analytics (Simple but Powerful)
Metrics
Daily revenue
Monthly revenue
Order count
Top-selling products
Backend
Aggregation pipelines
Date-based grouping
Frontend
